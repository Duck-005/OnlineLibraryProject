# GUI Version

Currently, the GUI is made using the native GUI development package, Swing. Although swing has 
plenty resources online, all of them are outdated. <br>
all in all the package is very convoluted to understand and definitely would not recommend.

There are several tabs that the user can navigate to like see issued books, available books, return
or add books to the library, issue books, see the history and number of books available.

### About section
The Color theme of the UI is chosen sky blue and background as a faded black but not quite grey.

### Table rendering
All the data is extracted and loaded onto a table and can be scrolled.

### Issuing Books
After clicking on the issue books button a window pops up that prompts you to add the ID of the
book you want to issue and confirms the same.

### Technical details summary
* All the data is extracted on startup through the constructor `onlineLibrary_V4()` and loaded onto
ArrayLists to be processed further along.
* The data is converted to Object multidimensional arrays and passed as arguments to the
`JTable()` Constructor.
* The logo for the OnlineLibraryProject is generated by chatGPT and modified for proper size and font.
* The data for the books was taken from kaggle and customised according to our use case ( Columns in table ).
