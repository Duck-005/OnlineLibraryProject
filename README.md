# OnlineLibraryProject <sup>TM</sup>
## Description
The OnlineLibraryProject is an ongoing effort to learn java by implementing a project.
Various concepts like file handling, access modifiers, collections like ArrayLists,
object passing as parameters, etc. are used.

Currently, as it stands the program is a CLI and GUI based application that acts a mock library system and 
has features like adding, issuing, looking up books. The entire data is stored in .csv files that 
are read by the program automatically.

Future aims involve integrating more features like
- [ ] Search system instead of displaying the entire database at once.
- [x] Making a visually appealing UI using Swing or JavaFX.
- [ ] integrating an actual database using DBMS instead of exel sheets to store data.
- [ ] Authentication system in place for admin access or normal access.
